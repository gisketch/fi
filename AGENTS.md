# Agent Map

Project: fi-ui

Primary agent: Codex
Enabled agents: Codex, Copilot, Claude Code, Pi, Antigravity

Codex reads this file first. Keep it short. It is the map, not the manual.

## Default Behavior

- Read [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) before large changes.
- Default to caveman style for chat: terse, exact, no filler. Use normal prose only for safety, irreversible actions, or user confusion.
- Stay inside harness engineering: repo-local context, small maps, execution plans, checks, and doc updates.
- For new product context, use `/init-sonata` and update [docs/project-brief.md](docs/project-brief.md).
- For existing project cleanup or migration, use `/retrofit-sonata` before feature work.
- For multi-step work, create or update an execution plan in [docs/exec-plans/active](docs/exec-plans/active).
- Run checks from [docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md) before final handoff.
- If an agent struggles twice on the same class of issue, add a doc, script, test, fixture, or rule.

## Knowledge Map

- [docs/project-brief.md](docs/project-brief.md): product intent and constraints.
- [docs/core-beliefs.md](docs/core-beliefs.md): harness philosophy, including small-file modularity.
- [docs/architecture/index.md](docs/architecture/index.md): structure and boundaries.
- [docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md): validation commands.
- [docs/exec-plans/README.md](docs/exec-plans/README.md): planning workflow.
- [docs/references/harness-engineering.md](docs/references/harness-engineering.md): harness principles.
- [docs/references/caveman.md](docs/references/caveman.md): compression rules.

## Current Project Facts

- Kind: pwa for ios
- Stack: vite spa
- Package manager: bun
- Default caveman mode: full
- Agent targets: Codex, Copilot, Claude Code, Pi, Antigravity

## Work Loop

1. Clarify goal and acceptance criteria.
2. Read only relevant docs.
3. Plan at the smallest useful level.
4. Implement inside documented boundaries.
5. Validate with current checks.
6. Update docs when behavior, decisions, or constraints change.

## Sonata Integrations

- Antigravity is enabled. Project skills live in `.agents/skills/`; prompt templates live in `.agents/prompts/`.
- Pi is enabled. Project skills live in `.pi/skills/`; prompt templates live in `.pi/prompts/`. For Serena in Pi, install `pi-serena-tools` only after reviewing the package.
- Daily coding stack: use Serena for symbol-aware navigation, reference lookup, and refactors.
- Serena: prefer semantic tools for code structure work: symbol overview, find symbol, find references, and symbol-level edits. Use for non-trivial code navigation and refactors.
- Do not use Serena for tiny text-only edits, docs-only changes, exact log inspection, or when no MCP/Pi Serena tools are available; fall back and mention why.
- See [docs/context/serena.md](docs/context/serena.md).
